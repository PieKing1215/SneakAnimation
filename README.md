# SneakAnimation
### Minecraft Forge mod that lets you tweak the first person smooth sneaking animation

Adds a modifier to the camera smoothing when sneaking.<br>
The modifier can be changed in the in-game config.<br>
There is also an option to disable the smoothing entirely.<br>

This mod does not change anything about sneaking other than the camera animation.

This mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.

### [Releases](https://github.com/PieKing1215/SneakAnimation/releases)

Requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config-forge) so the config screen works.

## Speeds & Demo
The config lets you set the speed anywhere from 10% to 250%<br>
100% is vanilla, and anything above 200% makes the animation "bounce" a bit.<br>
### 50% Speed:<br>

Other mods shouldn't conflict unless they also change the sneak animation.
